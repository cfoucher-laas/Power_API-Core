description: List of a shield sensors that can be acquired by Spin ADCs

compatible: "shield-sensors"

properties:
  sensor-name:
    type: string
    required: true
    description: Name under which the sensor will be referred to in user code.

  default-gain:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: Value of the gain (multiplication to be applied on the raw measured value).
                 The value represents a float32_t, thus is stored in IEEE754 format.

  default-offset:
    type: int
    required: false
    description: Value of the offset (to be added after the raw value has been multiplied by the gain).
                 The value represents a float32_t, thus is stored in IEEE754 format.

	 * @note  This function can't be called before the sensor is enabled

	 *        or by starting the Uninterruptible task.

	 *        latest converted value for the same sensor as this function
	 *        will clear the buffer and disregard all values but the latest.
	 *
	 * @param sensor_name Name of the shield sensor from which to obtain values.
	 * @param number_of_values_acquired Pass an uint32_t variable.

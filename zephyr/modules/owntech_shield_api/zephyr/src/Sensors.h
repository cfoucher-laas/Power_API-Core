	 *
	 * @param adc_number Number of the ADC on which channel is to be enabled.

	 *        of these values is returned as an output parameter: the

	 *        of the function. The variable will be updated with the
	 *        number of values that are available in the buffer.
	 *
	 * @note  This function can't be called before the channel is enabled
	 *        and the DataAPI module is started, either explicitly
	 *        or by starting the Uninterruptible task.
	 *
	 * @note  When calling this function, it invalidates the buffer
	 *        returned by a previous call to the same function.
	 *        However, different channels buffers are independent
	 *        from each other.

	 *        latest converted value for the same channel as this function
	 *        will clear the buffer and disregard all values but the latest.
	 *
	 * @param channel Name of the shield channel from which to obtain values.
	 * @param number_of_values_acquired Pass an uint32_t variable.
	 *        This variable will be updated with the number of values that
